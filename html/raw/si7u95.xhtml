<p><span style="font-size:0.86em">Kayise, age 60, had failed her vision test for her driver’s license. All her life she had suffered from extreme near-sightedness. In fact, without her glasses she was legally blind. When she was denied her license renewal, Kayise came to Dr Nobadula for help. During an examination, it became clear that Kayise had cataracts in both eyes. A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye, which reduces vision. The lens is inside the eye and focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye, where an image is recorded. The lens also adjusts the eye’s focus. The lens is made of mainly water and protein. The latter is arranged so the lens stays clear, allowing light to pass through it. Yet, with age, the protein may form clumps that cloud the lens. This is a cataract. The best solution to Kayise’s situation was surgery that removed the cataracts and implanted tiny artificial lenses within the eye. Dr Nobadula conducted this procedure. Today, for the first time in her life, Kayise enjoys 20/20 vision without glasses.</span></p>
